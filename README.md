# Web Chat App - Firebase Workshop

Hello and welcome to Developer Student Club (DSC) First Virtual Workshop of 2021. Today, we will be covering Firebase - a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.

There are 2 branches:
- master contains the finalized code
- starter-code shows which shows what I will working on throughout the presentation. 

## Links
For this project, we will be using React and Firebase, so if you do not have React installed; follow this article:
[How to install React.js with create-react-app](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-react-with-create-react-app/) by Cem Eygi.

Alternatively, if you like to know how to host a website on Firebase, check out this article from our UI/UX Engineer Tyler Goodman
[How to host your react app on firebase](https://dev.to/technicallyty/how-to-host-your-react-app-on-firebase-2p2i)

Before beginning with the workshop, make sure you have your account set up on [Fireabase](https://firebase.google.com/)

*Also, have a text editor downloaded on your computer before cloning this repository. You can use whichever text editor of your choosing (Atom, Sublime, Notepad++). For this
demonstration, I will be using Visual Studio Code.*


## React - Instructions
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
